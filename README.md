# jme4180-vibration6

In this experiment, the mode shapes of an undamped cantilever beam were determined by theoretical, simulative, and experimental modal analysis. Using a force hammer, the fixed end beam was excited at various locations along its length and the response was recorded. This response was then used to find the mode shapes seen in the vibrations of the beam and was then compared to the theoretical and simulation analyses.
